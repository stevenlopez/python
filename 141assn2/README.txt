I named my program main.py
to run my program you type in      python main.py "filename"     

For example if I wanted to run my small dataset I would write python main.py input52small.txt
it'll give an output file with _trace.txt added to it(not the expected output)
there you'll have the minseam on top and the how we got there below it.
